# Romeo Plate

Hey you. You need a plate for your Romeo v1 board? Did you look all around and even check the closed issue list on the official repo? Me too. It doesn't exist.

So I made one from the files on the official repo. I cut mine with 1.5mm POM and it works just like it should.

Here's official repo: https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/romeo
